sudo libinput list-devices

Thanks for the detailed output — it confirms that your internal keyboard is:

Device: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard  
Kernel: /dev/input/event3

We’ll now disable it using a udev rule that works under Wayland.

✅ Step-by-Step: Disable Built-in Keyboard (Wayland, KDE)

1. Create a new udev rule

Open a terminal and run:

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/00-disable-laptop-keyboard.rules

2. Paste the following line:

ACTION=="add", ATTRS{name}=="AT Translated Set 2 keyboard", ENV{LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE}="1"

This tells the system to ignore the device when it’s detected.

> ⚠️ Make sure the name is exactly "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" (copy-paste it from your libinput list-devices output).



3. Save and Exit

Press Ctrl + O, then Enter to save.

Press Ctrl + X to exit the editor.

4. Reload udev rules

Apply the new rule with:

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger


---

5. Reboot your system

reboot

✅ After reboot, the built-in laptop keyboard will be disabled. You can now use your external USB keyboard without interference.


---

🔄 To Re-enable the Built-in Keyboard Later

1. Delete the rule:

sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/00-disable-laptop-keyboard.rules


2. Reload and reboot:

sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo reboot



Let me know if you'd like to make this conditional (e.g. disable only when USB keyboard is plugged in).
